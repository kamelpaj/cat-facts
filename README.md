A web application created by [Adam Hermansson](https://github.com/qurridutt) at [Malmö University](https://mau.se/) for the course [Cross-platform Applications with Web Technologies](https://edu.mah.se/en/Course/DA355A).

The project uses [Alex Wohlbruck](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck)'s API [Cat Facts](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts) to fetch facts about cats and displays it in a pretty manner.
